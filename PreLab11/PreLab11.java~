/** Lab 11 will introduce you to reading input from a file and writing data to a file. 
  * As a warmup, we are going to read input from a String. Look up the StringReader class in the API. 
  * Create a StringReader object using the string "CSDS132". 
  * Then, use the read method to read each character, one at a time, from the string. 
  * Finally, state how you can tell when the last character of the String is read.
  * You may give an English description or you can enter Java code that does the test. */
